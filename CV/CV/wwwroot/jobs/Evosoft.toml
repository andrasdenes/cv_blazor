I worked on a **complex engineering software**, and up to this day I still work on some of its components.
Since January 2022 our agile team was assigned a new project and we have been working on that ever since. We are
developing a solution to make certain data more accessible to all the engineering software that we can support.
Our **REST** interface supplies all the required data to customers, in the exact format they require.

One thing I'm responsible for is product configuration. This sounds easy enough but actually it is quite challenging.
Think about buying a car. Some parameters will inevitably have an effect on other parameters - but how do the 
affected parameters relate to the previous ones? Or perhaps completely different options should be selected?

I also actively take part in the data-management solution. I develop **REST** endpoints, write unit and integration tests, review code and
fix the occasional error - be it in the data access layer or as simple as the **DTO** definition.

Recently I also became responsible for our **CI system**, that is just a fancy name for a bunch of **Jenkins** jobs.

I'm lazy, so I have automated some of my work at Evosoft - using **python and C#** - to ease my life and others' and naturally, 
to produce consistent results. Probably these automations are what I'm the most proud of since **I saved a bunch of effort to developers,
and probably a lot of money for the company**.

Finally, to top everything else, in March, 2021 me and 2 colleagues **took part in a hackathon in Szeged, Hungary and our app idea got such 
a decent amount of recognition that Evosoft and the city of Szeged decided to actually realize the App**. This project makes us well versed in 
**Blazor**.
